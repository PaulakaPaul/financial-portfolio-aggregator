# Motivation
Usually you will have in your portfolio different types of financial instruments: stocks, etfs, bonds, commodities etc.
The scope of this project it's to `aggregate` all the `financial instruments` to their root: stocks & bonds. In this way you will
have a clearer vision in what you invest & how much you invest. Also you will have all kind of statistics: `region`, 
`sector`, `p\e ratio` etc. for all your portfolio.
